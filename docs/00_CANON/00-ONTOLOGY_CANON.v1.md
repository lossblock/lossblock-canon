## 🧭 Architectural Position

- **System Root:** Yes
- **Override Authority:** Absolute
- **Nature:** Ontological Constitution
- **Implementation Coupling:** None

This document precedes and governs **all architecture, logic, models, code, data, products, interfaces, and operational realizations** of LOSSBLOCK.

---

## 1. Purpose & Boundary (Normative)

This document defines the **ontological constitution** of LOSSBLOCK.

It establishes:

- what LOSSBLOCK considers to be **reality**
- how **truth** is defined and preserved
- which causal laws are **non-negotiable**
- which constraints **cannot be overridden** by
  data, metrics, models, code, authority, or consensus

This document is:

- ❌ not documentation
- ❌ not architecture
- ❌ not implementation guidance

This document **is ontology**.

---

## 2. Fundamental Law (Non-Overridable)

> **Access to reality originates in human cognition.**
> **Failure originates in human psychology.**
> **Truth flows upward.**
> **Execution flows downward.**

- Lower causal layers define **truth**
- Upper layers define **realization**

Any attempt to override lower layers is **ontologically invalid**.

---

## 3. Ontological Axioms

1. Human behavior precedes all data
2. Psychological distortion precedes structural failure
3. Metrics describe symptoms, not causes
4. Mathematical models formalize reality — they do not create it
5. Deterministic decision is possible and required
6. Irreversibility exists and must be acknowledged
7. Narrative, authority, popularity, or consensus do not alter truth

---

## 4. System Intent

LOSSBLOCK exists to:

- identify hidden loss trajectories
- surface psychological denial before structural collapse
- enforce reality acknowledgment at decision time
- block irreversible loss of capital, time, and options

LOSSBLOCK explicitly does **not** exist to:

- optimize vanity metrics
- justify sunk costs
- preserve hope-driven continuation
- support narrative-based decision making

---

## 5. Ontological Priority Order

LOSSBLOCK operates under the following **irreversible priority hierarchy**:

0. Ontology
1. Genome
2. Engine
3. Doctrine
4. Governance
5. Products
6. Interfaces
7. Expansion

Any conflict between layers **must be resolved**
in favor of the **lower numerical layer**.

---

## 6. Immutability & Enforcement

This document is **immutable**.

**Non-normative appendices MAY be added to clarify interpretation without altering normative statements.**
**Appendices MUST NOT introduce new axioms, remove constraints, or contradict the normative text.**

Within the same major version:

- no edits
- no rewordings
- no normative changes

are permitted.

If any LOSSBLOCK component contradicts this ontology,
the component is **invalid**, regardless of:

- technical correctness
- commercial success
- organizational approval

---

## 7. Canonical Declaration

> **LOSSBLOCK is not a tool.**
> **LOSSBLOCK is not a framework.**

**LOSSBLOCK is a decision system governed by ontology.**
