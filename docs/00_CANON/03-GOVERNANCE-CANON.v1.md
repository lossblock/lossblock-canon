## Legal Notice

This document is part of the **LossBlock Ontology** intellectual property system.

It governs **ontological truth**, not organizations, people, or processes.

No organizational structure, committee, commercial interest,
or technical control mechanism
may override the constraints defined herein.

Violations of these principles invalidate any dependent artifact,
regardless of implementation correctness or business approval.

---

## 1. Purpose & Boundary _(Normative)_

This document defines **how canonical truth is governed** within LOSSBLOCK.

It establishes:

- how canonical documents achieve canonical status
- how canonical documents evolve
- how contradictions are resolved
- how authority over truth is exercised
- how immutability is enforced

This document does **not** define:

- company or legal governance
- operational workflows
- contributor roles
- approval hierarchies
- access control or permissions

Governance here refers **exclusively**
to the governance of **ontology and canon**.

---

## 2. Fundamental Governance Law _(Non-Overridable)_

> **Truth is not governed by consensus.**
> **Truth is not governed by authority.**
> **Truth is governed by ontology.**

Governance exists to **protect truth from human distortion**,
not to empower humans to modify truth.

Any governance action that alters truth
without ontological justification
is **invalid by definition**.

---

## 3. Canonical Authority Hierarchy _(Normative)_

Canonical authority is strictly hierarchical:

0. Ontology Canon
1. Layer Model Canon
2. Tier 0 — Human Failure Canon
3. Genome Canon
4. Engine Canon
5. Doctrine Canon
6. Governance Canon (procedural only)
7. Products, Interfaces, Expansion

Lower layers:

- define **what is true**
- constrain all higher layers

Higher layers:

- MUST conform
- MUST NOT reinterpret lower layers
- MUST NOT introduce contradictions

No governance mechanism may override
a lower canonical layer.

---

## 4. Canon vs Governance Separation _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK enforces a strict separation between:

- **Canon** — immutable ontological truth
- **Governance** — controlled evolution of canon

Governance:

- does not define truth
- does not reinterpret truth
- does not optimize truth
- does not soften truth

Governance exists solely to ensure that
**changes to canon are rare, explicit, justified, and visible**.

---

## 5. Canonical Change Eligibility _(Normative)_

A canonical change is eligible **only if** one or more apply:

- a formal contradiction is discovered
- an ambiguity enables multiple valid interpretations
- a lower-layer omission invalidates higher-layer logic
- an internal ontological inconsistency exists

The following are **explicitly invalid reasons** for change:

- market or competitive pressure
- product or implementation needs
- usability or adoption concerns
- commercial opportunity
- narrative discomfort
- organizational preference

Canon does not adapt to convenience.
Convenience adapts to canon.

---

## 6. Change Mechanism _(Normative)_

All canonical changes require:

1. **Major version increment only** (`v2.0+`)
2. Formal RFC submission
3. Explicit ontological justification
4. Public canonical diff
5. Full dependency impact analysis
6. Explicit statement of irreversible consequences

Minor or patch versions
are **not permitted** for canonical documents.

---

## 6.5 Initial Canonization _(Normative)_

A document achieves canonical status **v1.0** when:

1. It explicitly declares itself canonical
2. It contains no internal contradictions
3. It does not conflict with lower-layer canon
4. It declares scope, dependencies, and immutability policy

Initial canonization **does NOT require an RFC**.

RFC procedures apply **exclusively**
to major version changes (`v2.0+`).

---

## 7. Normative vs Non-Normative Content _(Normative)_

Immutability applies **exclusively** to **normative statements**.

Non-normative content MAY be added
in the form of appendices for clarification purposes only.

Non-normative content:

- MUST be explicitly labeled
- MUST NOT introduce new axioms
- MUST NOT alter causal authority
- MUST NOT resolve contradictions
- MUST NOT change interpretation of normative text

If a clarification alters interpretation,
it is **not a clarification**
and requires a major canonical revision.

---

## 8. Decision Authority _(Normative)_

Canonical decisions are **not democratic**.

Canonical verification requires:

- At least one ontologically competent reviewer
- Explicit confirmation:
  **“This change reflects reality more accurately.”**

If reviewers disagree on ontological grounds,
the proposed change is **INVALID**.

Reviewer identity, quantity, or authority
are **not governance concerns**.

Ontological correctness must be self-evident,
or the canon remains unchanged.

---

## 9. Immutability Enforcement _(Normative)_

Within a major version:

- no edits
- no rewordings
- no clarifications
- no additions
- no removals

are permitted to **normative text**.

Violations result in:

- invalidation of the modified component
- reversion to last valid canonical state
- invalidation of all dependent artifacts

Immutability is defined by ontology,
not by tooling.

---

## 9.5 Technical Enforcement _(Non-Normative)_

Immutability MAY be enforced through:

- content hashing (e.g., SHA-256)
- version control signatures
- automated validation pipelines
- publication integrity checks

Technical mechanisms **do not define immutability**.

A manually edited canonical document
remains **INVALID**
even if technical systems fail to detect the violation.

---

## 10. Canonical Conflict Handling _(Normative)_

If canonical statements conflict:

1. Identify the lowest canonical layer involved
2. Treat it as authoritative
3. Invalidate or constrain higher-layer statements

If a conflict exists **within the same layer**:

- the system is ontologically inconsistent
- no execution, product, or decision may proceed
- resolution requires a major canonical revision

---

## 10.5 Version Conflicts _(Normative)_

Only **ONE major version** of a canonical document
may be active at any time.

When **v2.0** is canonized:

- **v1.0** becomes **DEPRECATED**
- all dependencies MUST migrate to v2.0
- systems referencing v1.0 are **INVALID**

Parallel major versions
are **NOT permitted**.

---

## 11. Human Failure Acknowledgment _(Normative)_

Governance explicitly assumes the presence of:

- cognitive bias
- ego preservation
- authority distortion
- fear-driven decision making

These failure modes are formalized in:

- `docs/00_CANON/02-TIER0-HUMAN_FAILURE-CANON.v1.md`

Governance is designed to counter Tier 0 primitives:

- **T0-02 Decision Mass** → enforced explicit justification
- **T0-03 Strategic Noise** → ontological grounding only
- **T0-06 Systemic Inertia** → default to immutability

Governance is self-aware of its own failure vectors.

---

## 12. Canonical Declaration

> **Governance exists to stop humans from corrupting truth.**
> **If governance becomes flexible, truth collapses.**

LOSSBLOCK governance is intentionally rigid,
slow, and hostile to convenience.

That is its function.

---

## Appendix A: RFC Structure _(Non-Normative)_

This appendix defines a **recommended structure**
for Canon RFC submissions.

It does **not** introduce new canonical rules.

### A Canon RFC SHOULD include:

1. **Canonical Reference**
   - Document ID
   - Section(s) affected
   - Current normative statement(s)

2. **Ontological Justification**
   - Type of failure
     (contradiction, ambiguity, omission, inconsistency)
   - Evidence of ontological incorrectness
   - Reference to violated axioms or causal laws

3. **Proposed Change**
   - Exact normative text modification
   - Public canonical diff

4. **Impact Analysis**
   - Affected canonical layers
   - Affected dependent documents
   - Irreversible consequences

5. **Verification Criteria**
   - Conditions under which reviewers confirm:
     _“This change reflects reality more accurately.”_

RFCs lacking ontological grounding
are **INVALID and ignored**.
