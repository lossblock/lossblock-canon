## Legal Notice

This document is part of the **LossBlock Ontology** intellectual property system.

It defines **where LOSSBLOCK may and may not be applied**.

No organizational authority, commercial interest,
or technical convenience
may extend LOSSBLOCK beyond the scope defined herein.

Any application of LOSSBLOCK outside this scope
is **ontologically invalid**.

---

## 1. Purpose & Boundary _(Normative)_

This document defines the **canonical scope of applicability** of LOSSBLOCK.

It establishes:

- domains where LOSSBLOCK is valid
- conditions under which LOSSBLOCK may be applied
- conditions under which LOSSBLOCK MUST NOT be applied
- hard exclusion criteria
- limits of responsibility and authority

This document does **not** define:

- implementation strategies
- product positioning
- market segmentation
- legal compliance boundaries
- ethical frameworks beyond ontology

**Scope defines WHERE LOSSBLOCK applies — not HOW or WHEN.**

---

## 2. Fundamental Scope Law _(Non-Overridable)_

> **LOSSBLOCK applies only where human cognition
> materially influences irreversible outcomes.**

“Materially influences” means **dominance, not mere presence**:

- human decisions can alter final outcomes
- psychological factors can dominate structural constraints
- denial or bias can prevent reality acknowledgment

If outcomes are determined primarily by:

- natural laws
- automated processes
- stochastic forces beyond human control

then human cognition does **not** materially influence outcomes,
and LOSSBLOCK is **NOT applicable**.

LOSSBLOCK does not analyze systems.
LOSSBLOCK analyzes **humans operating within systems**.

---

## 3. Required Domain Characteristics _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK MAY be applied only to domains
that satisfy **ALL** of the following conditions:

### 3.1 Human Decision Agency

Outcomes depend on human judgment,
not purely automated or natural processes.

### 3.2 Irreversibility

Actions can permanently destroy
capital, time, trust, or strategic options.

### 3.3 Psychological Distortion Risk

Cognitive bias, denial, fear, or ego
can materially affect decisions.

### 3.4 Delayed Feedback _(Strategic Level)_

Strategic consequences are **not immediately visible**,
enabling self-deception about long-term outcomes.

Delays are **typically measured in weeks, months, or years** —
not hours or days.

Immediate tactical feedback does **NOT** disqualify a domain
if strategic irreversibility remains hidden.

Examples:

- **SEO:** clicks are immediate; competitive position shifts are delayed
- **Product launch:** early adoption is visible; structural ceiling is not

### 3.5 Structural Constraints

The domain contains real limits
that cannot be bypassed by effort, optimization, or narrative.

If **ANY** condition is not met,
LOSSBLOCK **MUST NOT** be applied.

---

## 4. Canonically Valid Domains _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK is canonically valid in domains characterized by:

### Strategic Capital Allocation

- investment decisions (VC, PE, corporate ventures)
- M&A and long-term partnerships
- infrastructure and real estate commitments
  _(YES: funding rounds, acquisitions • NO: routine operational expenses)_

### Market Position Decisions

- market entry and expansion
- pricing and demand viability
- competitive positioning under saturation
  _(YES: entering a saturated market • NO: daily bid adjustments)_

### Long-Horizon Execution

- product development with irreversible architecture
- platform dependencies and lock-in
- content and demand capture strategies
  (e.g., SEO, brand, distribution moats)
  _(YES: domain strategy • NO: daily content tweaks)_

This list is **illustrative, not exhaustive**.

Inclusion requires satisfaction of **ALL**
conditions in Section 3.

If doubt exists about applicability,
default to **NON-APPLICABILITY**.

---

## 5. Canonically Invalid Domains _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK MUST NOT be applied to:

- real-time control systems
- safety-critical automation
- purely statistical or stochastic modeling
- short-cycle optimization problems
- domains with immediate, reversible feedback
- domains governed primarily by physical law
- ethical or moral judgment frameworks
- domains where human agency is negligible

Using LOSSBLOCK in these domains
constitutes a **category error**
_(applying a framework outside its ontological domain)_.

---

## 6. Boundary Conditions _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK:

- does **NOT** predict outcomes
- does **NOT** optimize execution
- does **NOT** replace domain expertise
- does **NOT** guarantee success
- does **NOT** remove uncertainty

LOSSBLOCK **DOES**:

- enforce reality acknowledgment
- constrain decisions by irreversibility
- expose psychological denial
- surface structural limits
- block continuation past option collapse

When expertise conflicts with LOSSBLOCK,
the system MUST **investigate for denial**
before concluding override of canon.

LOSSBLOCK operates at the intersection of:

- domain expertise (what is possible)
- psychological reality (what humans refuse to see)

Persistent conflict indicates **unacknowledged denial**,
not LOSSBLOCK error.

---

## 7. Partial Applicability _(Normative)_

LOSSBLOCK MAY be applied **partially**
to complex domains where:

- some decisions meet scope criteria
- other decisions remain out of scope

In such cases:

- scope boundaries MUST be explicit
- outputs MUST declare applicability limits
- no inference may be made beyond scoped decisions
- interdependencies MUST be acknowledged

### Interdependency Rule

If Decision A (in scope) depends on
Decision B (out of scope),
LOSSBLOCK analysis of A MUST:

- declare the dependency explicitly
- treat B as a boundary condition
- NOT extend scope to cover B

**Positive Example:**

- In scope: irreversible platform choice
- Out of scope: reversible feature prioritization
- Valid: platform analysis assumes feature velocity X

**Negative Example (Scope Violation):**

- Invalid: platform analysis determines optimal feature roadmap

Silent scope expansion
is **invalid by definition**.

---

## 8. Scope Violation Detection _(Normative)_

The following indicate **SCOPE VIOLATION**.

### Applying LOSSBLOCK when:

- irreversibility is absent
- human agency is negligible
- feedback is immediate and reversible
- structural constraints do not exist
- outcomes are primarily stochastic

### Misusing LOSSBLOCK to:

- justify continuation despite clear limits
- optimize execution instead of constraining decisions
- predict outcomes rather than acknowledge limits
- override structural ceilings through narrative
- replace domain expertise with ontological rules

### Valid LOSSBLOCK usage indicators:

- outputs constrain decisions, not optimize them
- irreversibility is explicit
- psychological primitives are referenced
  _(e.g., T0-01 Demand Reality Gap, T0-02 Decision Mass)_
- structural limits are acknowledged
- option collapse is surfaced if present

Scope violations invalidate
all derived outputs and decisions.

---

## 9. Relation to Other Canon Documents _(Normative)_

- **Ontology Canon** → defines what truth is
- **Layer Model Canon** → defines where truth resides
- **Tier 0 Canon** → defines why failure originates
- **Governance Canon** → defines how canon evolves
- **Scope Canon** → defines where LOSSBLOCK applies

Scope constrains **ALL** higher layers.

Any change to scope
requires **Governance Canon v2.0+ procedures**.

---

## 10. Canonical Declaration

> **If a domain cannot tolerate
> explicit acknowledgment of irreversibility,
> LOSSBLOCK does not belong there.**

LOSSBLOCK exists only where
**unacknowledged denial destroys value**.

---

## Appendix A: Scope Applicability Decision Tree _(Non-Normative)_

To determine if LOSSBLOCK applies to domain **D**:

1. Are outcomes influenced by human decisions?
   → NO → LOSSBLOCK does NOT apply
   _(e.g., weather prediction, chemical reactions)_
   → YES → continue

2. Can decisions cause irreversible loss?
   → NO → LOSSBLOCK does NOT apply
   _(e.g., A/B testing UI colors)_
   → YES → continue

3. Can psychological factors materially distort decisions?
   → NO → LOSSBLOCK does NOT apply
   _(e.g., fully automated arbitrage)_
   → YES → continue

4. Is strategic feedback delayed?
   → NO → LOSSBLOCK does NOT apply
   _(e.g., real-time trading bots)_
   → YES → continue

5. Do structural constraints exist?
   → NO → LOSSBLOCK does NOT apply
   → YES → LOSSBLOCK applies

If **ANY** answer is NO,
LOSSBLOCK does **NOT** apply.

When in doubt,
default to **NON-APPLICABILITY**.

---

## Appendix B: Scope Audit Checklist _(Non-Normative)_

Use this checklist to audit deployed systems:

- [ ] Is irreversibility explicitly identified?
- [ ] Are scope boundaries documented?
- [ ] Are Tier 0 primitives referenced where relevant?
- [ ] Are outputs constraining decisions (not optimizing)?
- [ ] Are dependencies on out-of-scope decisions declared?
- [ ] Is continuation past option collapse blocked?
- [ ] Is expertise respected while denial is challenged?

Any failed check indicates
a potential **scope violation**.
