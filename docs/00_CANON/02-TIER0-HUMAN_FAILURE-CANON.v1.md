## Tier 0 — Human Failure Layer

### Canonical Psychological Primitives

Tier 0 defines **formalized psychological failure primitives** that drive
strategic, financial, and operational collapse.

Tier 0 **does not model markets**.
Tier 0 **does not model systems**.
Tier 0 **does not model metrics**.

Tier 0 models **human cognitive fear, denial, bias, and self-deception**.

> Bad outcomes are caused by the **mind**, not by the environment.

## Degradation Cascade — Phase Structure

Human failure progresses through **five dominant degradation phases**:

| Phase | Name           | Meaning                                 |
| ----- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1     | ILLUSION       | Reality distortion and false confidence |
| 2     | SELF-DECEPTION | Metrics masking truth                   |
| 3     | DELAY          | Time avoidance and inertia              |
| 4     | LOSS           | Capital and structural decay            |
| 5     | CATASTROPHE    | Option and reversibility collapse       |

Phases describe **dominant psychological modes**, not mandatory sequences.

Transitions **may be non-linear, cyclic, overlapping, or skipped**
depending on psychological pressure and time constraints.

## Formal Interpretation

### Ordered by Degradation Dominance (T0-01 → T0-10)

Tier 0 works because it models the **human mind**, not the market.
It formalizes fear-driven irrational behavior that leads to collapse.

### T0-01 — Demand Reality Gap (DRG)

Belief in imagined demand.
**Question:** Does demand exist — or is it desired?

### T0-02 — Decision Mass (DM)

Avoidance of responsibility through delayed commitment.
**Question:** Is inaction driven by evidence — or fear of accountability?

### T0-03 — Strategic Noise (SN)

Metrics used to hide reality rather than reveal it.
**Question:** Do numbers clarify reality — or replace it?

### T0-04 — Competitive Saturation (SAT)

Blindness to structural demand limits.
**Question:** Is the market already full regardless of quality?

### T0-05 — Time Distortion (TD)

Inability to tolerate temporal uncertainty.
**Question:** Is waiting rational — or an escape from uncertainty?

### T0-06 — Systemic Inertia (IN)

Resistance to change driven by loss aversion.
**Question:** Are you constrained by reality — or by attachment to the current state?

### T0-07 — Capital Evaporation (CE)

Continued investment driven by sunk cost avoidance.
**Question:** Are you funding progress — or protecting ego?

### T0-08 — Structural Ceiling (SC)

Refusal to accept absolute limits.
**Question:** Is growth structurally possible?

### T0-09 — Option Collapse Point (OCP)

Denial of closing opportunity windows.
**Question:** Has optionality already collapsed?

### T0-10 — Irreversibility Threshold (IR)

Denial of final outcomes.
**Question:** Is this loss reversible — or final?

## Hopeium Trap™ — Psychological Failure Loop

Hopeium Trap™ describes a cognitive state where an actor:

- fears stopping
- fears admitting failure
- fears losing hope
- fears appearing foolish
- fears accepting final outcomes

This is **not** a business problem.
This is **not** a market problem.

This is a **human cognition failure loop**.

---

## Formal Primitive Semantics (Normative)

ψ-functions in Tier 0 are **symbolic formalizations**, not mathematical models.

They express **direction, dominance, or collapse**,
not computable quantities.

Semantic meanings:

- `→ ∞` — uncontrolled divergence from reality
- `→ 0` — loss of meaningful signal
- `↓ exp` — accelerating deterioration
- `= terminal` — irreversible final state

ψ-functions **must not** be interpreted as equations, metrics,
thresholds, or computational formulas.

---

## Tier 0 Scope & Boundary (Normative)

Tier 0 defines **psychological root causes only**.

Tier 0:

- does **not** infer outcomes
- does **not** prescribe decisions
- does **not** evaluate performance
- does **not** generate verdicts
- does **not** define detection criteria

Detection, signals, thresholds, false-positive handling,
and measurement belong exclusively to **higher layers**.

Tier 0 provides causal primitives that **must be interpreted
and operationalized only by higher layers**.

Any attempt to derive decisions, metrics, or actions
directly from Tier 0 is **ontologically invalid**.

---

## Core Conclusion

Tier 0 is a **machine against human self-deception**.

LossBlock does not optimize strategy.
LossBlock does not chase metrics.

LossBlock formalizes the fears that cause bad decisions.

> **Reality acknowledgment is enforced
> when the mind refuses to accept it.**
