## 1. Purpose & Boundary _(Normative)_

This document defines the **canonical layered model** of LOSSBLOCK.

It specifies:

- where **truth originates**
- how **causality propagates**
- which layers define **truth**
- which layers define **execution**
- how **conflicts between layers** are resolved

This document does **not** define:

- specific entities
- mathematical functions
- decision vocabularies
- implementation or operational processes

---

## 2. Model Nature _(Normative)_

The Layer Model is **prescriptive for LOSSBLOCK**.

It defines **how LOSSBLOCK MUST reason about reality**,
not a claim that all domains or systems are structured this way.

If a domain cannot be coherently mapped onto this model,
**LOSSBLOCK is not applicable to that domain**.

---

## 3. Fundamental Layer Law

> **Truth is defined in lower layers.**
> **Execution is defined in upper layers.**

Lower layers have **ontological authority**.
Upper layers **MUST NOT override** lower-layer truth.

Any behavior violating this rule is **ontologically invalid**.

---

## 4. Canonical Layer Stack

| Layer | Name                        | Domain               | Core Responsibility              |
| ----: | --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|     0 | Human Failure Canon         | Human Psychology     | Root causal primitives           |
|     1 | Cognitive Distortion Models | Cognition            | Formation of false belief        |
|     2 | Structural Failure Patterns | Strategy & Economics | Translation into loss            |
|     3 | Domain Manifestations       | Contextual Reality   | Environment-specific expression  |
|     4 | Signals & Observables       | Measurement          | Observable symptoms              |
|     5 | Formal Abstractions         | Computation          | Mathematical representation      |
|     6 | Decision Synthesis          | Judgment             | Deterministic decision formation |
|     7 | Execution & Impact          | Reality              | Action and realization           |

This ordering is **absolute and irreversible**.

---

## 5. Sub-Layer Extension Rule _(Normative)_

Canonical layers **MAY** contain internal sub-layers for refinement.

Sub-layers:

- MUST NOT alter canonical layer order
- MUST NOT introduce new authority levels
- MUST NOT override parent-layer responsibility

Sub-layers are **implementation detail**,
not new canonical layers.

---

## 6. Layer Responsibility Separation

Each layer has a **single dominant responsibility**.

- Lower layers explain **why** failure occurs
- Middle layers explain **how** failure becomes visible
- Upper layers explain **what** is done in response

No layer may:

- redefine truth from a lower layer
- absorb responsibilities of a lower layer
- bypass intermediate layers

---

## 7. Causal Flow

Human Psychology
→ Cognitive Distortion
→ Structural Failure
→ Domain Manifestation
→ Observable Signals
→ Formal Abstraction
→ Decision
→ Execution

LOSSBLOCK **may analyze in reverse order**,
but **authority never reverses**.

Reverse analysis is **diagnostic only**
and MUST NOT override lower-layer truth.

This model defines ontological authority only.

Monitoring, learning, adaptation, communication,
temporal analysis, and governance are SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
that MUST NOT introduce new truth or override lower layers.

They operate strictly within constraints imposed
by the canonical layer order.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution Rule

When contradictions appear:

1. Identify the **lowest layer involved**
2. Treat its output as **authoritative truth**
3. Constrain or invalidate higher-layer outputs

No exceptions for:

- performance pressure
- business incentives
- consensus
- organizational authority

---

## 9. Boundary Violations

The following constitute **canonical violations**:

- Signals redefining psychological truth
- Models overriding observed human behavior
- Decisions contradicting structural limits
- Execution proceeding despite acknowledged irreversibility

Violating components are **invalid by definition**.

---

## 10. Relation to Other Canon Documents

- **Ontology Canon** → defines _what truth is_
- **Layer Model Canon** → defines _where truth resides_
- **Tier 0 Canon** → defines _root causal primitives_
- **Governance Canon** → defines _how canon evolves_
- **Scope Canon** → defines _where LOSSBLOCK applies_

---

## Canonical Declaration

> **The Layer Model is the structural spine of LOSSBLOCK.**
> **Without strict layers, truth collapses into narrative.**
