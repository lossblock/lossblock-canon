# LossBlock Canon

This repository contains the canonical ontological foundation of the
**LossBlock Decision Intelligence System**.

The documents in this repository define:

- what truth is (Ontology Canon)
- where truth resides (Layer Model Canon)
- which human psychological failures cause collapse (Tier 0 Canon)
- how canonical truth is governed and protected (Governance Canon)
- where LOSSBLOCK is applicable and where it is not (Scope Canon)

All documents in this repository are **CANONICAL** and **IMMUTABLE**
within their major version.

## What This Repository IS

- An ontological constitution for the LOSSBLOCK system
- A formal definition of reality, causality, and decision authority
- A protection layer against human cognitive distortion
- A foundation for all LOSSBLOCK products, engines, and interfaces

---

## What This Repository IS NOT

This repository does **NOT** contain:

- implementation code
- algorithms or thresholds
- decision engines or scoring logic
- optimization methods
- product interfaces or APIs

This repository defines **truth and constraints**, not execution.

## Canonical Reading Order

All documents MUST be read in the following order:

1. `docs/00_CANON/00-ONTOLOGY_CANON.v1.md`
2. `docs/00_CANON/01-LAYER_MODEL-CANON.v1.md`
3. `docs/00_CANON/02-TIER0-HUMAN_FAILURE-CANON.v1.md`
4. `docs/00_CANON/03-GOVERNANCE-CANON.v1.md`
5. `docs/00_CANON/04-SCOPE-CANON.v1.md`

This order is mandatory to preserve ontological correctness.
